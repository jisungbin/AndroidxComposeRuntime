/**
 * A [PausableComposition] is a sub-composition that can be composed incrementally as it supports
 * being paused and resumed.
 *
 * Pausable sub-composition can be used between frames to prepare a sub-composition before it is
 * required by the main composition. For example, this is used in lazy lists to prepare list items
 * in between frames to that are likely to be scrolled in. The composition is paused when the start
 * of the next frame is near allowing composition to be spread across multiple frames without
 * delaying the production of the next frame.
 *
 * The result of the composition should not be used (e.g. the nodes should not added to a layout
 * tree or placed in layout) until [PausedComposition.isComplete] is `true` and
 * [PausedComposition.apply] has been called. The composition is incomplete and will not
 * automatically recompose until after [PausedComposition.apply] is called.
 *
 * A [PausableComposition] is a [ReusableComposition] but [setPausableContent] should be used
 * instead of [ReusableComposition.setContentWithReuse] to create a paused composition.
 *
 * If [Composition.setContent] or [ReusableComposition.setContentWithReuse] are used then the
 * composition behaves as if it wasn't pausable. If there is a [PausedComposition] that has not yet
 * been applied, an exception is thrown.
