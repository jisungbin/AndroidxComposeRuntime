/**
 * RememberInComposition is used by an associated lint check to enforce that a marked constructor,
 * function, or property getter is not called directly within composition. This should be used to
 * mark APIs that:
 * - Return stateful / mutable objects that should be reused across compositions
 * - Return objects whose identity is important to maintain across compositions, for example
 *   lightweight objects used as 'keys' for other APIs
 * - Return objects that are expensive to instantiate, and should be remembered for performance
 *   reasons
 *
 * Note that the lint check will recommend that users either remember this call, or move it outside
 * composition. As a result this should not be used to mark APIs that are intended to be used inside
 * a side effect, as these should not be called inside a remember block.
