Compose Runtime Annotation

# Package androidx.compose.runtime.annotation

The `androidx.compose.runtime.annotation` package provides annotations used by the compiler and
tooling. These annotations are published in a separate library to allow using these annotations in
modules that do not depend on Compose Runtime, but may be used with Compose in other modules.
