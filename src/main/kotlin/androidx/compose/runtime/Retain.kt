/**
 * Remember the value produced by [calculation] and retain it in the current [RetainScope]. A
 * retained value is one that is persisted in memory to survive transient destruction and recreation
 * of a portion or the entirety of the content in the composition hierarchy. Some examples of when
 * content is transient destroyed occur include:
 * - Navigation destinations that are on the back stack, not currently visible, and not composed
 * - UI components that are collapsed, not rendering, and not composed
 * - On Android, composition hierarchies hosted by an Activity that is being destroyed and recreated
 *   due to a configuration change
 *
 * When a value retained by [retain] leaves the composition hierarchy during one of these retention
 * scenarios, the [LocalRetainScope] will persist it until the content is recreated. If an instance
 * of this function then re-enters the composition hierarchy during the recreation, it will return
 * the retained value instead of invoking [calculation] again.
 *
 * If this function leaves the composition hierarchy when the [LocalRetainScope] is not keeping
 * values that exit the composition, the value will be discarded immediately.
 *
 * The lifecycle of the retained value can be observed by implementing [RetainObserver]. Callbacks
 * from [RememberObserver] are never invoked on objects retained this way. It is invalid to retain
 * an object that is a [RememberObserver] but not a [RetainObserver], and an exception will be
 * thrown.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a retained value is shown in the diagram below. This diagram tracks how a
 * retained value is held through its lifecycle and when it transitions between states.

 *
 * The default implementation is a [ForgetfulRetainScope] that causes [retain] to behave the same as

 * retains values across configuration changes.
 *
 * If this CompositionLocal is updated, all values previously returned by [retain] will be adopted
 * to the new scope and will follow the new scope's retention lifecycle.
 *
 * RetainScopes should be installed so that their tracked transiently removed content is always
 * removed from composition in the same frame (and by extension, all retained values leave
 * composition in the same frame). If the RetainScope starts keeping exited values and its tracked
 * content is removed in an arbitrary order across several recompositions, it may cause retained

/**
 * A RetainScope acts as a storage area for objects being retained. An instance of a RetainScope
 * also defines a specific retention policy to describe when removed state should be retained and
 * when it should be forgotten.
 *
 * The general pattern for retention is as follows:
 * 1. The RetainScope receives a notification from that transient content removal is about to begin.
 *    The source of this notification varies depending on what retention scenario is being captured,
 *    but could, for example, be a signal that an Android Activity is being recreated, or that
 *    content is about to be navigated away from/collapsed with the potential of being returned to.
 *    At this time, the scope's owner should call [requestKeepExitedValues].
 * 2. Transient content removal begins. The content is recomposed, removed from the hierarchy, and
 *    remembered values are forgotten. Values remembered by [retain] leave the composition but are
 *    not yet released. Every value returned by [retain] will be passed as an argument to
 *    [saveExitingValue] so that it can later be returned by [getExitedValueOrDefault].
 * 3. An arbitrary amount of time passes, and the removed content is restored in the composition
 *    hierarchy at its previous location. When a [retain] call is invoked during the restoration, it
 *    calls [getExitedValueOrDefault]. If all the input keys match a retained value, the previous
 *    result is returned and the retained value is removed from the pool of restorable objects that
 *    exited the previous composition. This step may be skipped if it becomes impossible to return
 *    to the transiently removed content while this scope is keeping exited values.
 * 4. The content finishes composing after being restored, and the entire frame completes. The owner
 *    of this scope should call [unRequestKeepExitedValues]. When retention stops being requested,
 *    it immediately ends. Any values that are retained and not currently used in a composition (and
 *    therefore not restored by [getExitedValueOrDefault]) are then immediately discarded.
 *
 * A given `RetainScope` should only be used by a single [Recomposer] at a time. It can move between
 * recomposers (for example, when the Window is recreated), but should never be used by two
 * Recomposers simultaneously. It is valid for a RetainScope to be used in multiple compositions at
 * the same time, or in the same composition multiple times.
