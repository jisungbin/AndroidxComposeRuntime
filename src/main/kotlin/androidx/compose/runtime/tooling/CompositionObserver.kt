 * [onScopeEnter] ━┓   // Composition enters a scope

 *                 ┏━ [onScopeExit]

 * [onScopeDisposed]   // Scope is discarded by composition and is no longer used.
 * ```
 *
 * The scopes can be invalidated at any point either by values previously reported in
 * [onReadInScope] or by calling [RecomposeScope.invalidate] directly. In these cases,
 * [onScopeInvalidated] will be called with the associated instance or `null` if the scope was
 * invalidated directly.
 *
 * Note that invalidation of the scope does not guarantee it will be composed. Some cases where it
 * is not composed are:
 * 1) The scope is no longer part of the composition (e.g the parent scope no longer executed the
 *    code branch the scope was a part of)
 * 2) The scope is part of movable content that was moved out of the composition.
 *
 * In the case of movable content, the scope will be recomposed as part of a different composition
 * when it is moved to that composition or it might be discarded (with a corresponding
 * [onScopeDisposed] call) if no other composition claims it.
