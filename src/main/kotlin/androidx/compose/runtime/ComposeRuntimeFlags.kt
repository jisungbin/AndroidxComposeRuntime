   * state being lost. However, this is a change in behavior may have indirectly been relied on by
   * an application. This flags allows detecting if any regressions are caused by this change in
   * behavior and provides a temporary work-around.

   * This feature flag will eventually be depreciated and removed. All applications should be

   * A feature flag that can be used to enable movable content usage tracking.
   *
   * With this feature flag enabled the usage of movable content instances is tracked to avoid
   * deferring the insert of content that is not currently in use. When movable content is
   * inserted (e.g. a movable content lambda is called for the first time, instead of being
   * recomposed) the insert is deferred until after all other composition has completed. This
   * allows detecting when instances of the movable content is removed from elsewhere in any
   * composition and can be moved to the location of the new call. However, when movable content
   * is not used this deferral will never end up finding removed content that matches so
   * deferring, in this case, is unnecessary.
