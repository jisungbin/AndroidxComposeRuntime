/**
 * Objects implementing this interface are notified of their usage in [retain].
 *
 * An object is retained when its first captured as the return result of the calculation block used
 * with `retain`. It is retired when the `retain` invocation is removed from composition and not
 * being retained. In between being retained and retired, objects may enter and exit the
 * composition. This occurs when the retained object is removed from composition but transiently
 * held on to if the removed portion of the composition hierarchy is to be restored with its
 * retained state.
 *
 * When objects implementing this interface are retained or entering composition together, their
 * [onRetained] and [onEnteredComposition] callbacks are dispatched in the order that they were
 * added to the composition. When objects exit composition together, the [onExitedComposition]
 * callback is invoked in the opposite order that the objects appear in the composition hierarchy.
 * There are no ordering guarantees around when or in what order the [onRetired] callback may be
 * dispatched.
 *
 * Objects that implement this interface and used in the composition as the result of a [remember]
 * call will receive no callbacks to this interface, and are encouraged to implement
 * [RememberObserver] either additionally or instead of `RetainObserver`.

   * This callback can be invoked after either [onRetained], to indicate that the value was
   * created but the composition was abandoned (see [RememberObserver.onAbandoned]), or after
   * [onExitedComposition]. When called after [onExitedComposition], this indicates that this
   * value was previously used in composition, but the content retaining this value has been
   * removed and will not be returned to (either because the relevant [RetainScope] was not
   * retaining at the time of removal, or the removed content was not restored after all retained
   * objects were restored).
   *
   * Implementations of this method can be used to release resources held by the instance.
   *
   * This callback does not guarantee any relative ordering among other RetainObserver instances.
   * Similarly, because the timing of a retainment period comes with no guarantees, there could be
   * an arbitrary delay between [onExitedComposition] and when this method is called â€” anywhere
   * between immediately after exiting the composition, a single frame later, or indefinitely
   * later.
